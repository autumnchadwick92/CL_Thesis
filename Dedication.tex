Begin typing body text here. Only the first line of each paragraph should be indented. Subsequent lines of text will be flush-left. If dedicating your thesis/dissertation to multiple people, choose the plural heading. Otherwise, choose the singular heading. This page will be counted, but not numbered. Make sure that your dedication takes up one page at most.
